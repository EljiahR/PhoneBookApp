<h1>Coding Tracker Project</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Simple project made to track length of coding sessions using an sqlite database via a C# console application, similar to the habit tracker with a few additional challenges</p>
<h3>Assigned requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is an application where you should record contacts with their phone numbers.</li>
  <li>Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read from a database, using the console.</li>
  <li>You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.</li>
  <li>Your code should contain a base Contact class with AT LEAST {Id INT, Name STRING, Email STRING and Phone Number(STRING)}</li>
  <li>You should validate e-mails and phone numbers and let the user know what formats are expected</li>
  <li>You should use Code-First Approach, which means EF will create the database schema for you.</li>
  <li>You should use SQL Server, not SQLite</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Completed Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Expand the app by creating categories of contacts (i.e. Family, Friends, Work, etc).</li>
